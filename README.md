# T Cell Dry Immersion Bed Study

This repository contains necessary files to evaluate and reproduce the core data analysis steps
of the T cell dry immersion (DI) bed study. The effects of weightlessness on T cell gene expression 
are investigated using this ground-based model of microgravity. Volunteers were exposed to DI 
during a 3-week period in which weekly blood samples were collected, in addition to pre- and post-immersion
control samples drawn 7 days before and after DI, respectively. CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated 
followed by RNA sequencing.
